            <h2 class="section-title">Biology</h2>
            Spiders are arachnids, not insects. They have eight legs, no wings, and two body segments: the cephalothorax and abdomen. Many produce silk, which they use to spin webs and capture prey. Spiders can have up to eight eyes, each providing a different type of vision.
